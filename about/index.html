            <h1 class="ab-head">Background</h1>
          <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>After seeing so many posts on public forums about frauds and scams people face daily, I came up with an idea to solve this problem. Then to extend that, I thought about its diversion and its possibilities. People face scammers every day in their lives, for example, you can check the <b>scam</b> folder of your email inbox, you’ll see hundreds of people sending unwanted and virus-infected emails. Many like those sometimes bypass that scam filter and reach to your main inbox, where they can breach your personal data and infect your pc. Or sometimes, they just ask for money. Similar to that, some people call on your personal number and tell you about a lottery you won or simply spam you with ads. 
          <br><br><div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>Similarly, there are scammers on twitter, facebook and other social media websites that try to sell you something or spam you with ads. I’ve seen many groups with such fraudulent sellers, who hire people and then block them after completion of their job. Many businessmen are tricked by such scammers and they actually lose a lot of capital because of them. Freelance market is filled with such people too.
          <br><br><div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>Additionally, some people scam by meeting in person. They sell unwanted stuff and trick you with their buttery pitch. There are some restaurants where people call them for fake orders, with their fake addresses and that cause a lot of wastage of resources and capital. <br>

          <h1 class="ab-head">Need of Central Forum</h1>
          <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>When you face a scammer and waste a lot of time and money on him, you share his info with most of your friends so they could avoid any dealings with the scammer in future. Some people post that info in a facebook group or tweet about it. When business companies face such scammers, they add that name to their blacklist or their local repository. 
<br><br><div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>But that is not a complete solution to eliminate them and to save others. We need a central repository to list and share such scammers, so other people could be benefited. A place where business companies could add them so their competitors could be saved from such frauds. <br>

          <h1 class="ab-head">Concept of Spamsort</h1>
         <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>Spamsort is a website where people can list spammers/scammers/frauds. Name, Phone Number, Social ID, Business Type, Email Addresses, Location and description can be added. The description includes all the details of the event happened to them. 
<br><br><div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>There is a real-time search engine where people can search for the above mentioned keywords. Narrow-down feature is included so people can add multiple keywords to narrow their search. <br>

          <h1 class="ab-head">Adding Spammers</h1>
         <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>Spammers are added so that everyone can view them and avoid business with them. Like I mentioned, Spamsort is intended to be a central repository, so sharing with all other people could be like “Saving the World”. You are literally saving the world by adding spammers. It helps other people to extract credible businesses by elimination process. 
<br><br><div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>To add spammers, logging-in is required. It is required so people could be prevented from spamming the website. 
<br>
<h1 class="ab-head">Searching Spammers</h1>
         <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>When you are confused whether the person hiring you is a fraud or not, or the person selling you something is real or fake, you can search his/her name on Spamsort and check credibility of the person. The search engine is real-time so you won’t be required to wait for the page to load again and again. 

<br>
<h1 class="ab-head">Spamsort Dashboard</h1>
         <div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>When you log-in to your account, you’ll be displayed a dashboard. You can see the number of people you’ve added so far, and view their description. You’ll be given an option to add a spammer and manage them.
<br>
<h1 class="ab-head">Account Verification</h1>
<div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>Just to be sure, we’ll verify your account by multiple methods. Following are some points that can cause Account Rejection:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Redundant Accounts, when name or info is similar to an already made account.</li>
<li>Unclear description, when the info you sent about yourself is vague or unreadable.</li>
<li>Failed to Verify email, when the email address you sent is fake or you aren’t verifying it</li>
<li>False information, when the Name or Info is clearly not yours.</li>
<li>Fake IP addresses, the people using VPNs or fake identities will not be accepted in Spamsort</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="ab-head">Spammer Verification</h1>
<div style="padding-left:2.5em;display: inline;"></div>When you add a spammer, make sure to add a valid one. The person you add is immediately added to main index, we’ll verify that by asking you through your email address. We can ask for screenshots, URLs, or further evidences. The spammers will not be added if:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Redundant Spammers, when name or info is similar to an already added listing.</li>
<li>Unclear description, when the info you sent about spammer is vague or unreadable.</li>
<li>Failed to Verify Info, when we ask for evidences and you don’t respond.</li>
<li>False information, when the Name or Info is clearly not legit.</li>
<li>Fake IP addresses, the people using VPNs or fake identities will not be accepted in Spamsort</li>
<li>Adding an ad in description</li>

</ul>
