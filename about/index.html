                <br>
                The website is for listing the spammers and we do not want that to be spammed too. 'We are preventing spam from a spammer website'.
                <br><br>
                <b>Where is my data used when I sign up?</b>
                <br>
                The website only requires users to enter their email and password. We neither have any interest in you, nor in your personal data.
                <br><br>
                <b>Why the website looks incomplete and so blank?</b>
                <br>
                The website is currently in beta testing. We are planning to add more features so just stay tuned.
                <br><br>
                <b>When is the website going to be released?</b>
                <br>
                The website will be release as soon as the coding part is complete. There are a lot of features to be added.
                <br><br>
                <b>Why is the website so colorful?</b>
                <br>
                Because, I wanted the website to have a little bit of Googley touch. The background is AJAX based dynamically designed, so it automatically updates on specific events.
                <br><br>
                <b>Why is my search not working well?</b>
                <br>
                Because the website is in beta testing mode and many features are yet to be added. There are many queries that are yet to be handled. Be precise in your searches to get best results.
