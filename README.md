This code is for the project SpamSort which is currently listed on SpamSort.com

What is spamsort?

SpamSort is a website to list all the spammers, frauds and scammers around you. It enlists spam cases so that
no one in the future could fall for them.

How is it useful?

Such a website is more demanding in business sector. No one wants to invest their value in frauds or spammers.
Furthermore, freelancers could use it so that they only do work with reliable people. Even restaurants, where 
some people call, in the name of fun, tease and spam. Such people should be listed in some directory.



How can spammers be added?

Login here: http://spamsort.com/login/ ; then a form will appear. Fill that form will all the useful details
about the spammer and click "Submit Spammer", and it will be added in real time.


Why am I required to login to submit spammers?

The website is for listing the spammers and we do not want that to be spammed too. 'We are preventing spam 
from a spammer website'.


Where is my data used when I sign up?

The website only requires users to enter their email and password. We neither have any interest in you, nor
in your personal data.


Why the website looks incomplete and so blank?

The website is currently in beta testing. We are planning to add more features so just stay tuned.


When is the website going to be released?

The website will be release as soon as the coding part is complete. There are a lot of features to be added.


Why is the website so colorful?

Because, I wanted the website to have a little bit of Googley touch. The background is AJAX based dynamically
designed, so it automatically updates on specific events.


Why is my search not working well?

Because the website is in beta testing mode and many features are yet to be added. There are many queries that
are yet to be handled. Be precise in your searches to get best results.
